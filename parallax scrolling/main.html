				<title>House of Stark</title>
				<pre style="margin-top:20px;">
House Stark was one of the Great Houses of Westeros,
ruling over the vast region known as the North from their seat in Winterfell. 
The head of the house is the Lord of Winterfell. 
Before the Targaryen conquest, 
the leaders of House Stark ruled over the region as the Kings in the North.</pre>
				<pre style="margin-top:220px;">
House Stark's sigil is a grey direwolf on a white field,
sometimes white and pale green. 
They are one of the few noble Houses whose family words are not a boast or threat. 
Instead, the House Stark family motto is the ominous warning,
"Winter is Coming".</pre>

					ddard Stark, is the head of House Stark and Lord Paramount of the North. He is a dedicated husband and father, a loyal friend and an honourable lord. Eddard becomes Hand of the King to his lifelong friend, Robert Baratheon, when the previous hand dies in suspicious circumstances. He follows his predecessor's footsteps and uncovers an incestuous relationship between Queen, Cersei Lannister, and her brother, Ser Jaime Lannister.<br/><br/>
					Robert dies after being injured while hunting and Eddard challenges the legitimacy of his successor, Joffrey Baratheon, but is betrayed by his political allies and arrested for treason. He confesses to the crime to protect his family, but is nevertheless executed due to Joffrey's impulsive sadism. The conflict between House Stark and House Lannister sets the stage for the War of the Five Kings.
